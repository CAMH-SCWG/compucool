# Workshop Title

--------

**Wifi SSID**: `workshop`

Some sample software you'll need to install:

- **Windows**: [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
- **Mac and Linux**: You're already set

---------

Here's how you include links to files:

1. [demographics.csv](/lrn2compute/workshops/data/demographics.csv)
2. [volumes.csv](/lrn2compute/workshops/data/volumes.csv)
3. [SES_data.csv](http://www.hamclubs.info/lists/SES_data.csv)

And here's how you include a block of code: 

{% highlight r %}
this = is.r.code()
if like(you,r) {
   i.exit()
}
{% endhighlight %}

But if you want python: 

{% highlight python %}
try: 
   to_learn(python)
finally: 
   something(decent)
{% endhighlight %}
