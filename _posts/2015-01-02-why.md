#### Basically

Research is becoming more computational and you've probably never been formally
trained in general computing skills. 

#### That's a problem. 

These workshops will focus on some basic computing skills you need for getting
your study data organized, doing repeatable/reproducible analysis, and making
use of the CAMH compute cluster (SCC) to save time. 

You should attend if you are doing any sort of scientific computing work. If
you have questions, send me email: jon.pipitone@camh.ca.
