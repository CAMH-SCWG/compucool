#### Because ...

... research is becoming more computational and you've probably never been
formally trained in general computing skills. 

#### That's a problem. 

*Software is your experimental apparatus.*

Just like cleaning test tubes and pipetting, computing is a basic skill you
need to be competent with. 

These workshops will focus on some computing skills fundamentals you'll need
for getting your study data organized, doing repeatable/reproducible analysis,
and making use of the CAMH compute cluster (SCC) to save time. 

You should attend if you are doing any sort of scientific computing work, or
work that involves repetition that could be automated. If you have questions,
send me email: jon.pipitone@camh.ca.
