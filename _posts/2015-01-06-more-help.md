What more help/instruction? There are lots of things going on at CAMH and U of T that you can get involved in: 

- **Weekly Office Hours - CS 163, Tuesday 1-2pm

  All staff, students and trainees welcome to drop in. This is an informal space to ask your knowledgeable colleagues about any computing issue, programming/scripting question, or analysis design.

- **Peers Teaching Peers - CS 163 Tue 12-1pm, Lunch provided!**

  Weekly presentations by students and staff. The purpose of PTP is simply to get others thinking about how they may implement a method they are not familiar with and/or to build a working relationship with someone to help you with that method. 
  
- **[University of Toronto Scientific Coders](http://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/)**

  Meets weekly to run workshops and co-working sessions. 

- **[SciNet Events and Courses](https://support.scinet.utoronto.ca/education/browse.php)**

  SciNet is U of T's super computing organization. Don't let that intimidate you though; they run amazing introductory courses on linux, R, Python, and HPC.
