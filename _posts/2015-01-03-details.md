#### Introduction to Linux
</div>

<div class="card-body">
Computers aren't scary (yet) and knowing how to use them will make doing
science better/easier/quicker.

**You'll learn:** 

 - About Unix/Linux (hint: it's the operating system of choice for scientific computing)
 - What a terminal/shell is. 
 - Managing (making, moving, editing) files and folders
 - Remote access (SSH/FTP)
 - Where to find help online/etc.
 - Some super useful Linux commands

**Prerequisites:** none

#### Using the CAMH Specialised Computing Centre
</div>
<div class="card-body">

The Specialised Computing Centre (SCC) is CAMH's own super-computer.

You can use this to massively speed up your processing-intensive analyses by
distributing your work across many computers at once.

**You'll learn:**
 
  - How the SCC is organized
  - How to connect to the SCC
  - Suitable tasks for the SCC
  - How to run many tasks in parallel 

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with the Unix shell

#### Automating Tasks in Linux
</div>
<div class="card-body">
Doing work on lots of data by hand is boring and error prone. Learn how to
write shell scripts to automate your work so that it is repeatable and
reproducible. 

**You'll learn:** 

 - Running commands on many files (globbing, looping, if statements)
 - reading and writing to files & sorting/filtering data in files
 - writing scripts, chaining tools together (pipes, redirection)
 - running commands in parallel, running commands in parallel on the SCC/SciNet

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with Linux (e.g. cd, ls, mv, cp)

#### Introduction to R
</div>
<div class="card-body">
R is a featureful and sometimes magical language for doing statistical
analysis. And it's free. This workshop won't cover much about the stats you can
do with R, but will get you started using R. 

**You'll learn:** 

 - using the Rstudio IDE
 - basic R syntax/commands
 - writing R scripts
 - using/installing packages
 - reading/sorting/merging/filtering tabular data (e.g. CSV files)

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with another programming language
</div>

<div class="card">
<div class="card-title">
#### Data munging with R
</div>
<div class="card-body">

The hardest part is often getting your data in order. 

In this workshop you'll learn some fundamental ways of organizing and
manipulating datasets, as well as modelling and visualising your data. 

**You'll learn:**
  
  - Melting/casting dataframes
  - Transforming your data
  - Exporting data
  - Linear modelling 
  - Plotting and visualization with ggplot2 and others

**Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with R
